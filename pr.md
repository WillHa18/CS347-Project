I really liked the color scheme of the website. I thought the colors were picked very well and it is very appealing to look at. One difference between my project
and yours is that we have two different uses for our sites. For mine it is sort of like a Patreon type platform, and yours is more like Amazon.
I think my website would be easier to maintain because I have all my CSS in their own files for each page, which makes it easier to work with in the long term. 
The only issue I came across was not being able to access the other HTML files and pages.
